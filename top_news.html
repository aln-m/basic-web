			<img src=./image/top2.jpg>
			<p>Heavy fighting has erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, with both civilians and combatants killed. Accusing Azerbaijan of air and artillery attacks, Armenia reported downing helicopters and destroying tanks, and declared martial law. Azerbaijan said it had begun a counter-offensive in response to shelling.
			The region is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by ethnic Armenians.
            They broke away in the dying years of the Soviet Union. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan were part of the communist state, which sought to suppress ethnic and religious differences.
            Amid the clashes, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said he was confident of regaining control over the breakaway region.

			<h1>Belarus: Mass arrests and tear gas on seventh weekend of protests</h1>
			<img src=./image/top4.jpg>
			<p>Belarus police carried out mass arrests as tens of thousands of people again gathered for protests calling on leader Alexander Lukashenko to step down.
            More than 50 people were detained on Sunday, rights groups said.
            Video footage appeared to show police spraying an irritant directly into the faces of protesters in one city.
            It was the 50th day of protests following August's disputed presidential vote. Earlier this week Mr Lukashenko held a secret inauguration.
            The electoral commission says Mr Lukashenko won a sixth term with more than 80% of votes. But the opposition says he cheated and that they won the election with at least 60% of the vote."
