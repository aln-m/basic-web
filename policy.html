			<h1>Durbin: ‘I worry about the outcome’ of the 2020 election</h1>
			<img src=./image/poli1.jpg>
			<p>Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said Sunday he hopes the 2020 election outcome will be fair, but that there are multiple factors at play working to undermine it.
            “We have so much meddling going on here,” Durbin said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” “We have the Russians still at work, the Chinese, perhaps the Iranians and others, we certainly have conspiracy theorists in this country.”

			<h1>Trump’s drug card plan sows confusion – even within administration</h1>
			<img src=./image/poli2.jpg>
			<p>President Donald Trump’s surprise pledge to send $200 drug discount cards to older Americans has left even his top deputies and health officials scrambling to explain how it would all work — assuming it’s even legal.
            The administration says it can put the plan in place using existing powers to test new ways of delivering health care. But critics see it as a brazen election year ploy to buy votes that could exceed presidential authority while sapping Medicare’s finances.

			<h1>A rising Black GOP star faces fury from African Americans over Taylor case</h1>
			<img src=./image/poli3.jpg>
			<p>Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron — the 34-year-old, up-and-coming Black Republican who snagged a prime-time speaking slot at Donald Trump’s convention last month — has been pegged as a potential successor to Mitch McConnell in the Senate someday.
            But after his handling of the Breonna Taylor case this week, Cameron will have to get there over the fierce opposition of many African Americans in his home state and across the country.
            For months, Cameron resisted intense pressure to charge the officers who shot and killed Taylor, 26, in her own home in March. Eventually the case went to a grand jury, which this week cleared two of the three officers involved in the shooting. During a lengthy news conference Wednesday, Cameron refused to say whether he recommended exoneration."

			<h1>Senate Dems ready tactics to muck up Supreme Court confirmation</h1>
			<img src=./image/poli4.jpg>
			<p>Senate Democrats can’t stop Mitch McConnell from confirming a new Supreme Court justice, but they are already planning to make it as painful as possible.
            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has his caucus on board with an effort to disrupt and obstruct Senate Republicans, using a wide range of procedural tools to try to make it difficult for the Senate majority leader.
            Interviews with more than a dozen Democratic senators revealed broad support for disrupting the Supreme Court confirmation process, even if the strategy yields some collateral damage. Yet Democrats facing tough reelections and those who typically spurn delay tactics overwhelmingly support the hardball campaign, potentially putting them at increased risk of losing their seats."
